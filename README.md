Foxtrot is a multipurpose bot intended to give images and facts about animals, memes, and more!
	
Foxtrot is open-sourced so people could help fix issues, and to stop people thinking we are doing malicious things with the bot.
	
Foxtrot also is not made to be self-hosted, but can be self-hosted if done correctly and changed a few things in the code and added your own bot's token in a token.json.
