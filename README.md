# Foxtrot
Foxtrot is a single-purpose bot designed to give you images of animals, memes, and other miscellaneous stuff.
## Invite
You can invite the bot to your discord [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=909103805264724038&permissions=274878032896&scope=bot%20applications.commands)
## Discord  
There is no discord server specifically for Foxtrot, but the discord for Kitsune is [here](http://discord.kitsune.icu/)
# Self-hosting
## Requirements
1. Latest version of Python3
2. Linux Operating System (Recommended)
## Installation
Installation is simple and you hardly need to do anything.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IPD-Dev/Foxtrot
cd Foxtrot
touch token.json
echo {BOT TOKEN} >> token.json
```
You might need to install things with pip, such as discord, and discord.ext. But hopefully you should just be able to run the bot with the start.sh
